# Basic Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe Smart Contract



## Project Title
**Basic Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe**

## Project Description
A blockchain-powered tic-tac-toe game that ensures provable fairness. The game allows two players to compete against each other on the Ethereum blockchain. Each player takes turns making a move on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The use of Ethereum ensures that the game is transparent, tamper-proof, and fair. All moves are stored on the blockchain, making the game immutable and verifiable.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to demonstrate how blockchain can be used to create decentralized games with verifiable fairness. By using smart contracts on Ethereum, this game removes the possibility of cheating, as all game data is publicly available on the blockchain, and each playerâ€™s move is auditable. The goal is to create a transparent, fun, and secure game environment for players around the world.

## Future Scope
- **User Authentication**: Integrate wallet-based user authentication (using MetaMask or other Ethereum wallets) for seamless player management.
- **Multi-round Support**: Extend the contract to support multiple rounds, allowing players to play more than one game consecutively.
- **Betting Mechanism**: Implement a betting system where players can wager Ether before each game, and the winner takes the prize.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Expand the contract to support more than two players, or create a system for tournament-style play.
- **Mobile App**: Create a mobile app or web interface that interacts with this smart contract, making it easy for users to play the game directly from their phones.
- **Gas Optimization**: Enhance the contract's efficiency to reduce gas costs for players, making it cheaper to play.

## Key Features
- **Two-player Game**: The game supports two players who take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid.
- **Provable Fairness**: Each move is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness. Players can verify every move made.
- **Move Validation**: Players can only make valid moves (not on an already occupied cell) and must take turns.
- **Winner Detection**: The contract automatically detects when one player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Game Events**: The contract emits events such as when a game starts, when a move is made, and when the game ends, allowing easy integration with front-end interfaces.
- **Immutable Game State**: Once a game is started, its state is unchangeable and recorded on the blockchain, ensuring fairness and tamper-proof results.
